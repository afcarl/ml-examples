# ml-examples

These examples work best inside [ml-notebook](https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ml-notebook).

If you are running `ml-examples` with `ml-notebook`, then you don't need to do anything special. `ml-notebook` will clone this repository and update all the submodules.

If you are running `ml-examples` without `ml-notebook`, just run `./setup.sh` to download all the submodules.
